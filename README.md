NOTE: The below is currently out-dated and is being updated.

## Setup

### Google Cloud

You will need to first setup a GCP project and provision your account. The
following script will walk you through the steps, where PROJECTNAME contains no
spaces or special characters and will be the name of your GCP project:

```bash
./setup-gcloud.sh PROJECTNAME
```

Upon succesful completion, `PROJECTNAME.env` will contain your google cloud
configuration:

- PROJECT_ID
- GOOGLE_PAYER_SECRET_PATH
- EXTERNAL_IP
- SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
- SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64

### Switchboard

You will need to manually add the following variables to `PROJECTNAME.env`

- RPC_URL
- ORACLE_KEY
- CLUSTER [devnet/mainnet-beta]

### Grafana

Next we will need to provision the TLS certificate to view the Grafana dashboard

```bash
./setup-grafana.sh PROJECTNAME DOMAIN EMAIL
```

Follow the instructions then add the following outputted variables to the env
file:

- GRAFANA_HOSTNAME (your domain/subdomain that will host your grafana dashboard)
- GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD (can be set to any string used to login to the admin
  account)
- GRAFANA_TLS_CRT
- GRAFANA_TLS_KEY

## Deploy

Using the same `PROJECTNAME` as above, run the following command to build the
helm charts for your deployment:

```bash
./build-helm.sh PROJECTNAME
```

Then deploy your helm charts to your GCP cluster:

```bash
./deploy-helm.sh PROJECTNAME
```
